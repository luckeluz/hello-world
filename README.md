My first repository

Hey, just writing a bit about myself. I'm a Chemical Engineering student in Brazil.
When studying abroad at University of South Carolina in the USA I took some extra courses in programming, mainly Python and web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I really liked those courses and did pretty well on them and decided to go on with coding.
Now I'm trying to improve my Python programming skills and learn some other programming languages related to data science, which is a filed that recently picked my interest.
